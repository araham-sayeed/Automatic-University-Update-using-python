This project is a University Update Info System built using Python and Tkinter, integrating Pandas for data handling. It provides a GUI to display student data, upcoming holidays, events, and exam schedules from CSV files. Users can navigate through different sections using buttons, and the system includes an email feature to send updates via SMTP. The interface is designed with Tkinter widgets for an interactive experience.
